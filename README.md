Multimedia and embedding 1

In this task we want you to embed a simple audio file onto the page. You need to:

1. Add the path to the audio file to an appropriate attribute to embed it on the page. The audio is called audio.mp3, and it is in a folder inside the current folder called media.
2. Add an attribute to make browsers display some default controls.
3. Add some appropriate fallback text for browsers that don't support &lt;audio&gt;.
